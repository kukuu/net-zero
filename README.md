## Theme: 
Effect and consequence of global warming on life expectancy of top endangered species.

 
## Mission:
The mission of this work is to illuminate the profound impact of global warming on the life expectancy of critically endangered species, with focus on key benchmarks such as temperature, pressure and humidity within the United Kingdom. By meticulously analysing and articulating the correlation between rising temperatures and declining life expectancies among these species, we aim to raise awareness worldwide about the urgent need for carbon neutrality and the expansion of the green agenda under NetZero initiatives. Through our research and advocacy efforts, we seek to galvanise global action towards achieving NetZero emissions, fostering a sustainable future where biodiversity thrives, and endangered species are safeguarded for generations to come.
